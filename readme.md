# g1pd - Gen 1 Pokemon Display

## What?
This script allows streamers to display their current party to their viewers.

## Setup
1. Get [Viusal Boy Advanced Rerecording](https://github.com/TASVideos/vba-rerecording/releases) if you don't already use it.

2. [Get the latest version of g1pd](https://github.com/PeachIceTea/g1pd/archive/master.zip).

3. Get sprites you like, the only requirement being that they need to be named with their corresponding Pokédex number. I used [these](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads). Also, there needs to be a 0.png that matches the dimensions of the other sprites but is emtpy.

4. Extract g1pd into its own folder.

5. Extract the sprites into the "sprites" folder.

6. Run VBA and when the game is loaded. Load the script from Tools/Lua Scripting/New Lua Script Window...

7. Add the png files in the "party" folder to your OBS overlay.
