# g1pd - Gen 1 Pokemon Display

## What?
This script streamers to display their current party to their viewers. 

## Setup
1. Get [Viusal Boy Advanced Rerecording](https://github.com/TASVideos/vba-rerecording/releases) if you don't already use it.

2. [Get the latest version of g1pd](https://github.com/PeachIceTea/g1pd/archive/master.zip).

3. Get sprites you like, the only requirement being that they need to be named with their corresponding Pokédex number. I used [these](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads).

4. Extract g1pd into its own folder.

5. Extract the sprites into the "sprites" folder.

6. Run VBA and when the game is loaded. Load the script from Tools/Lua Scripting/New Lua Script Window...

7. Add the png files in the "party" folder to your OBS overlay.
